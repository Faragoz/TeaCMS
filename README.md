# TeaCMS

I developed this project when I was 14 or 15 years old as a hobby. Now that I have reviewed it again, I see all the problems it had and its security holes.

It was a CMS that emulated the Habbo Hotel website. I also participated in the development of the server that emulated the same game, although to a lesser extent.

The version I publish here is incomplete because it is all I was able to rescue, the file to create the database and the template of the website we developed are missing.

What I learned programming in this project has served me well throughout my life, since I acquired knowledge about technologies and their development. Undoubtedly, the best hobby I could have as a teenager.

I hope this source code can be useful/helpful to someone.
